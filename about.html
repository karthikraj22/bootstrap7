It provides an integral, inter-disciplinary education   - a unique intersection between theory and practice, passion and reason. The   College offers courses of study that are on the frontiers of knowledge and it   connects the spiritual and practical dimensions of intellectual life, in a   stimulating environment that fosters rigorous scholarship and supportive   community. This Institute is a great possession of the committed Trust called   'The Kongu Vellalar Institute of Technology Trust' in Erode District, Tamilnadu.   The noble Trust has taken the institute to greater heights since its inception   in 1983 and has established the college as a forum for imparting value based   education for men and women. <br />
                                    <p style="text-align:justify;" class="my-3 "> The word 'Kongu' refers to a region of the   southern state of India and the term 'Kongu Vellalar' specially means the   agricultural community, predominated in the west of Tamilnadu, which was   deprived of educational facility in those days. To achieve technical excellence   in their rural areas, 41 philanthropists from different walks of life who   realized the need for technical education for their region's economic strides,   formed collectively a Trust called 'The Kongu Vellalar Institute of Technology   Trust' and they tried to promote and develop equality of opportunity for the   rich and the poor.</p>
                                    <p  style="text-align:justify;" class="my-3"> Affiliated to Anna University Chennai,the college has   completed more than three decades of dedicated service to the people of India and abroad in the   field of Technical Education. The Institution has an area of    167 acres of land richly endowed with   beautiful greeneries. The college with its state-of- the- art infrastructural   facilities and excellent academic records has earned recognition   as one of the reputed educational institutions for men and women   in India.</p>
